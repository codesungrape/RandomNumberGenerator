# Overview of the UK National Lottery (Lotto)

Here’s an overview of the UK National Lottery, also known as Lotto, including changes to the ball numbers, jackpot structure, prize tiers, and odds of winning since it began.

## 1. Launch and Early Years (1994)

**Format**:  
When the UK Lotto launched on November 19, 1994, players selected 6 main numbers from 1 to 49. There were no bonus balls or additional number pools.

**Jackpot**:  
The initial jackpot prize was determined by the number of ticket sales, with a minimum prize of £1 million. The jackpot rolled over if there were no winners, but only for a limited number of draws.

**Runner-Up Prizes**:
- Match 5 + Bonus Ball: Approximately £100,000.
- Match 5: Around £1,500.
- Match 4: About £60.
- Match 3: Fixed at £10.

**Odds of Winning the Jackpot (6/49)**:  
About 1 in 13.98 million.

## 2. 2002 Update: Introduction of the Bonus Ball

**Format**:  
A Bonus Ball was introduced, providing an additional prize tier for those who matched 5 numbers plus the Bonus Ball.

**Jackpot**:  
Still based on ticket sales, with rollovers capped at three consecutive draws. If it reached the cap, the jackpot prize rolled down to lower tiers.

**Prize Structure**:  
Remained mostly the same, but Match 5 + Bonus Ball had a higher payout due to the added tier.

## 3. 2013 Update: Lotto Raffle

**Raffle Introduction**:  
In 2013, the Lotto Raffle was introduced, guaranteeing 50 additional prizes of £20,000 each. This increased the appeal by offering more ways to win.

**Format**:  
Still 6 from 49.

**Odds of Winning**:  
Unchanged at 1 in 13.98 million for the jackpot.

## 4. 2015 Major Update: Increase in Balls (6/59)

**Format Change**:  
The main pool increased from 49 to 59 numbers. Players now chose 6 numbers from 1 to 59.

**Jackpot**:  
Minimum jackpot was set to £2 million on Wednesdays and £3.8 million on Saturdays. The jackpot could roll over up to 5 times before it was shared with lower prize tiers.

**New Prize Structure**:
- Match 5 + Bonus Ball: Around £50,000.
- Match 5: Approximately £1,000 to £2,000.
- Match 4: Around £100 to £200.
- Match 3: Fixed at £25.
- Match 2: Introduced a £1 free Lucky Dip (free play).

**Odds of Winning the Jackpot (6/59)**:  
Increased to 1 in 45 million due to the larger number pool.

## 5. 2018 Update: Jackpot Rollovers and "Must-Be-Won" Draws

**Jackpot Cap**:  
The jackpot could now roll over up to 5 times. If no winner emerged after the fifth rollover, a "Must-Be-Won" draw was triggered, where the jackpot would be shared among winners in the next highest prize tier.

**Prize Structure Adjustment**:  
In "Must-Be-Won" draws, if no one matched all 6 numbers, the jackpot was distributed to lower tiers, making it more likely for other players to win substantial amounts.

**Raffle Removal**:  
The Lotto Raffle was discontinued in favor of larger jackpots and better odds at higher prize tiers.

## 6. Current Prize Tiers and Odds

**Jackpot**:  
Minimum jackpot amounts are approximately £2 million on Wednesdays and £3.8 million on Saturdays, with rollovers up to 5 times before triggering a "Must-Be-Won" draw.

**Runner-Up Prizes**:
- Match 5 + Bonus Ball: Around £1 million.
- Match 5: Approximately £1,750.
- Match 4: Around £140.
- Match 3: Fixed at £30.
- Match 2: £1 free Lucky Dip.

**Odds of Winning**:
- Jackpot (6/59): 1 in 45 million.
- Match 5 + Bonus Ball: 1 in 7.5 million.
- Match 5: 1 in 144,415.
- Match 4: 1 in 2,180.
- Match 3: 1 in 97.
- Match 2: 1 in 10.3.

## Summary of Changes Over Time

The UK Lotto has evolved to offer bigger jackpots and new prize tiers, but with increased odds due to more balls in the main pool. While the odds of winning the jackpot have become more challenging since the change from 6/49 to 6/59, "Must-Be-Won" draws and additional lower-tier prizes provide more opportunities for players to win meaningful amounts.
